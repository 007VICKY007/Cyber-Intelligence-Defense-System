# Cyber Intelligence Defense System

Welcome to the Universal Cybersecurity AI project! This project aims to develop an advanced AI system capable of detecting and preventing various cyber threats in real-time, including phishing attacks, malware infections, ransomware attacks, and insider threats. The AI will analyze network traffic patterns, identify anomalies indicating potential threats, and provide recommendations for mitigating associated risks.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/007VICKY007/universal-cybersecurity-ai.git
   cd universal-cybersecurity-ai
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the AI System**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This command will launch the AI system and begin monitoring network traffic for potential cyber threats.

2. **Access the Dashboard**

   The AI system includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing detected threats. By default, the dashboard is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Analyzing Network Traffic**

   The AI system continuously analyzes network traffic patterns. If it detects any anomalies or potential threats, it will log the details and provide recommendations for mitigation.
